# Flutterwave Payment Verification - Fix Applied ✅

## 🐛 Problem Identified

The error `"No transaction was found for this id"` was occurring because:

1. **Root Cause**: When using Flutterwave inline script, we open the payment modal directly without creating a pending transaction in our database first.

2. **Flow Problem**:
   ```
   User clicks "Fund Wallet"
   → Modal opens (NO database transaction created)
   → User completes payment
   → Callback fires with Flutterwave transaction
   → Verification endpoint looks for transaction in DB
   → ❌ NOT FOUND (because it was never created)
   ```

3. **Evidence from Logs**:
   ```
   Flutterwave verification response: { status: 'success', data_status: 'successful' }
   Payment details from Flutterwave: {
     tx_ref: 'FLW-e3dcfe53-39cd-46b1-9f02-9608231f6324-1762007946173',
     status: 'successful',
     amount: 1000
   }
   Transaction not found in database: {
     code: 'PGRST116',
     details: 'The result contains 0 rows'
   }
   ```

   ✅ Flutterwave said payment was successful
   ❌ Our database didn't have a transaction record

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Changed: `app/api/flutterwave/verify-payment/route.ts`

**Before**: Required transaction to exist in database before verification

**After**: Can create transaction on-the-fly during verification

#### Key Changes:

1. **Use `maybeSingle()` instead of `single()`**
   - Allows query to return null without error
   - Gracefully handles missing transactions

2. **Extract user_id from payment metadata**
   ```typescript
   // Try to get user_id from metadata
   if (paymentData.meta && typeof paymentData.meta === 'object') {
     userId = paymentData.meta.user_id || null;
   }
   
   // Fallback: Find user by email
   if (!userId && payment.customer && payment.customer.email) {
     const { data: profile } = await supabaseAdmin
       .from("profiles")
       .select("id")
       .eq("email", payment.customer.email)
       .single();
     
     if (profile) {
       userId = profile.id;
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Create transaction if it doesn't exist**
   ```typescript
   if (existingTransaction) {
     // Update existing
     await supabaseAdmin.from("transactions").update({...})
   } else {
     // Create new
     await supabaseAdmin.from("transactions").insert({
       user_id: userId,
       type: "deposit",
       amount: amountUsd,
       status: "completed",
       payment_method: "flutterwave",
       gateway_transaction_id: payment.tx_ref,
       ...
     })
   }
   ```

### Enhanced: `components/wallet/flutterwave-funding.tsx`

**Added critical metadata to Flutterwave config:**

```typescript
meta: {
  user_id: userId, // Critical: Used by verify endpoint
  funding_type: "Wallet Funding",
  customer_email: userEmail, // Backup way to identify user
}
```

This ensures the verification endpoint can identify which user made the payment.

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### New Flow:

```
1. User clicks "Fund Wallet"
   → Flutterwave modal opens
   → Config includes user_id in metadata

2. User completes payment
   → Flutterwave processes payment
   → Flutterwave callback fires

3. Verification endpoint receives callback
   → Verifies with Flutterwave API ✅
   → Checks if transaction exists in DB
   
   IF EXISTS:
     → Update transaction to "completed"
     → Update wallet balance
   
   IF NOT EXISTS:
     → Extract user_id from payment metadata
     → Create new transaction as "completed"
     → Update wallet balance

4. User sees success message
   → Wallet balance updated instantly
   → Transaction recorded in database
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Operations:

**Before**:
- ❌ Required pre-existing transaction (failed if not found)
- Used `.single()` which throws error on 0 results

**After**:
- ✅ Can handle missing transaction gracefully
- Uses `.maybeSingle()` which returns null on 0 results
- Creates transaction on-the-fly if needed

### User Identification Strategy:

**Priority 1**: Payment metadata `user_id`
```typescript
payment.meta.user_id
```

**Priority 2**: Email lookup
```typescript
payment.customer.email → profiles.email → user_id
```

**Fallback**: Error if neither works
```typescript
{
  success: false,
  error: "Cannot determine user for this payment"
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test the Fix:

1. **Restart your development server**:
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser console** (F12) and keep it visible

3. **Go to wallet page**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/wallet
   ```

4. **Try funding**:
   - Click "Fund Wallet"
   - Select Flutterwave
   - Enter: ₦1000
   - Click "Fund Wallet" button

5. **Complete payment with test card**:
   ```
   Card: 5531886652142950
   CVV: 564
   Expiry: 09/32
   PIN: 3310
   OTP: 12345
   ```

6. **Watch the console** - you should see:
   ```
   Payment callback received: {...}
   Verifying payment with ID: ...
   Verification result: { success: true, ... }
   ```

7. **Check server logs** - you should see:
   ```
   Transaction not found in database, creating new one
   Updating wallet balance: {...}
   Payment verified and processed successfully
   ```

8. **Verify wallet balance** increased by ~$0.61 (₦1000 / 1650 rate)

## ✅ Expected Results

### Success Scenario:

**Browser Console**:
```
✓ Payment callback received
✓ Verifying payment with ID: 9757612
✓ Verification result: { success: true }
```

**Server Console**:
```
✓ Flutterwave verification response: { status: 'success' }
✓ Transaction not found in database, creating new one
✓ Updating wallet balance: { adding: 0.606 }
✓ Payment verified and processed successfully
```

**UI**:
```
✓ Green success alert: "Payment successful! Your wallet has been funded."
✓ Wallet balance updated
✓ Flutterwave card shows new balance
```

### Database Check:

```sql
-- Check latest transaction
SELECT * FROM public.transactions 
WHERE payment_method = 'flutterwave' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;

-- Should show:
-- ✓ status: "completed"
-- ✓ type: "deposit"
-- ✓ payment_method: "flutterwave"
-- ✓ gateway_transaction_id: "FLW-..."
-- ✓ amount: ~0.606 (USD)
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If payment still fails:

1. **Check API keys are correct**:
   ```bash
   cat .env.local | grep FLUTTERWAVE
   ```
   - Both should have `TEST` for testing
   - Both should be from same account

2. **Check browser console for errors**:
   - Look for red error messages
   - Screenshot and share

3. **Check server console**:
   - Look for "Cannot determine user"
   - This means metadata isn't being passed

4. **Verify user is logged in**:
   - Make sure you're authenticated
   - Check `userId` is not null
