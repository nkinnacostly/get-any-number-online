# Flutterwave Integration - UPDATED to Official React Library

**Update Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Using Official Flutterwave React Library

---

## 🔄 What Changed?

I've updated the integration to use the **official Flutterwave React library** ([flutterwave-react-v3](https://github.com/Flutterwave/React-v3)) instead of a custom redirect-based implementation.

### Before (Custom Implementation):
- ❌ Redirected users to external Flutterwave page
- ❌ Required manual callback handling
- ❌ More complex verification flow

### After (Official Library):
- ✅ Opens Flutterwave modal (stays on your site)
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Simpler, cleaner code
- ✅ Official support from Flutterwave
- ✅ Automatic modal management

---

## 📦 New Package Installed

```bash
pnpm install flutterwave-react-v3
```

This is the official Flutterwave React library that provides:
- `useFlutterwave` hook
- `closePaymentModal` function
- Built-in modal UI
- Automatic event handling

---

## 🔧 Key Changes

### 1. Component Updated: `FlutterwaveFunding`

**New imports:**
```typescript
import { useFlutterwave, closePaymentModal } from "flutterwave-react-v3";
```

**How it works now:**

```typescript
// Configuration
const config = {
  public_key: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY,
  tx_ref: generateTxRef(),
  amount: parseFloat(amount),
  currency: "NGN",
  payment_options: "card,banktransfer,ussd,account",
  customer: {
    email: userEmail,
    name: userName,
  },
  customizations: {
    title: "Wallet Funding",
    description: "Add funds to your SMS Pool wallet",
  },
};

// Initialize hook
const handleFlutterPayment = useFlutterwave(config);

// Trigger payment
handleFlutterPayment({
  callback: (response) => {
    closePaymentModal(); // Close the modal
    handlePaymentSuccess(response); // Process payment
  },
  onClose: () => {
    console.log("Modal closed");
  },
});
```

### 2. Payment Flow

**New Flow:**
```
1. User clicks "Fund Wallet" button
   ↓
2. Flutterwave modal opens (overlay on current page)
   ↓
3. User enters card details in modal
   ↓
4. Payment processed
   ↓
5. Modal closes automatically
   ↓
6. Callback fires with payment response
   ↓
7. Backend verifies payment
   ↓
8. Wallet updated instantly
```

### 3. Benefits

✅ **Better UX:**
- User stays on your site
- No page redirects
- Faster payment experience

✅ **Simpler Code:**
- No need to handle redirects
- No need to parse URL parameters
- Cleaner callback handling

✅ **Official Support:**
- Maintained by Flutterwave
- Regular updates
- TypeScript support

## 🚀 Setup Instructions (Updated)

### Step 1: Environment Variables (Same as before)

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY=FLPUBK_TEST-your-key
FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY=FLWSECK_TEST-your-secret
FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_HASH=your-webhook-hash
```

### Step 2: Test Payment

```bash
npm run dev

# Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/wallet
# Click "Fund Wallet"
# Enter amount: ₦1000
# Click "Fund Wallet" button

# A modal will open (no redirect!)
# Use test card: 5531886652142950
# CVV: 564, Expiry: 09/32, PIN: 3310, OTP: 12345
```

## 📊 API Routes (Unchanged)

The backend API routes remain the same:
- ✅ `/api/flutterwave/verify-payment` - Still used for verification
- ✅ `/api/flutterwave/webhook` - Still handles webhooks

**Note:** The `/api/flutterwave/initiate-payment` endpoint is **no longer needed** with the official library since the modal handles initialization on the client side.

---

## 🔒 Security (Enhanced)

### Official Library Benefits:
- ✅ Flutterwave's built-in security
- ✅ PCI DSS compliant modal
- ✅ Secure token handling
- ✅ No card data touches your server

### Server-Side Verification (Unchanged):
- ✅ All payments still verified on backend
- ✅ Webhook backup still active
- ✅ Same security measures apply

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Cards (Same as before)

**Successful Payment:**
```
Card: 5531886652142950
CVV: 564
Expiry: 09/32
PIN: 3310
OTP: 12345
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Modal opens with Flutterwave UI
2. Enter card details
3. Complete OTP verification
4. Modal closes automatically
5. Success message appears
6. Wallet balance updates

2. ✅ No API routes need updating
3. ✅ Component automatically updated
4. ✅ Just install the package and restart

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Modal doesn't open?

**Check:**
1. Flutterwave public key is set in `.env.local`
2. Amount is at least ₦100
3. Browser console for errors

### Payment succeeds but wallet not updated?

**Check:**
1. Backend `/api/flutterwave/verify-payment` route
2. Database connection
3. Server logs for errors

### "Invalid public key" error?

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure key starts with FLPUBK_TEST- (test) or FLPUBK- (live)
# No extra spaces or quotes
NEXT_PUBLIC_FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY=FLPUBK_TEST-your-actual-key
```
