# Flutterwave Integration - Using Inline Script (No NPM Package Required)

**Update Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Working - No Package Installation Needed

---

## 🎯 Solution

Instead of using the npm package, I've implemented Flutterwave using their **inline checkout script** - this loads directly from their CDN and works perfectly without needing to install any packages.

### ✅ Advantages:
- **No npm package needed** - works immediately
- **Always up-to-date** - loads latest version from Flutterwave CDN
- **Smaller bundle size** - script loads only when needed
- **Official method** - recommended by Flutterwave docs
- **Same modal experience** - identical to React library

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Script Loading

The component automatically loads the Flutterwave checkout script:

```typescript
const loadFlutterwaveScript = () => {
  const script = document.createElement("script");
  script.src = "https://checkout.flutterwave.com/v3.js";
  script.async = true;
  script.onload = () => setScriptLoaded(true);
  document.body.appendChild(script);
};
```

### 2. Payment Initialization

When user clicks "Fund Wallet", it calls the global `FlutterwaveCheckout` function:

```typescript
window.FlutterwaveCheckout({
  public_key: "FLPUBK_TEST-...",
  tx_ref: "FLW-user-123-...",
  amount: 5000,
  currency: "NGN",
  payment_options: "card,banktransfer,ussd,account",
  customer: {
    email: userEmail,
    name: userName,
  },
  callback: (response) => {
    // Verify payment with backend
    handlePaymentSuccess(response);
  },
  onclose: () => {
    console.log("Modal closed");
  },
});
```

### 3. Modal Opens

Flutterwave's modal appears - same beautiful UI as the React library!

### 4. Payment Verification

After payment, the callback fires and verifies with your backend.

## ✅ No Installation Required!

You **DO NOT** need to run:
- ❌ `npm install flutterwave-react-v3`
- ❌ `pnpm install flutterwave-react-v3`

The script loads automatically from Flutterwave's CDN!

---

## 🚀 Testing

### Environment Setup (Same as before)

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY=FLPUBK_TEST-your-key
FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY=FLWSECK_TEST-your-secret
FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_HASH=your-webhook-hash
```

### Test the Payment

1. Run your app: `npm run dev`
2. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/wallet`
3. Click **"Fund Wallet"**
4. Select **Flutterwave** option
5. Enter amount: **₦1000**
6. Click **"Fund Wallet"** button

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Flutterwave modal opens
- ✅ Beautiful payment UI appears
- ✅ No page redirect!

## 📋 What Changed

### Component Structure

```typescript
// Before (tried to use npm package)
import { useFlutterwave } from "flutterwave-react-v3"; // ❌ Package not installed

// After (uses CDN script)
declare global {
  interface Window {
    FlutterwaveCheckout: (config: any) => void;
  }
}

// Script loads automatically
useEffect(() => {
  loadFlutterwaveScript();
}, []);

// Use global function
window.FlutterwaveCheckout(config);
```

### TypeScript Declaration

Added global declaration for TypeScript:

```typescript
declare global {
  interface Window {
    FlutterwaveCheckout: (config: any) => void;
  }
}
```

This tells TypeScript that `window.FlutterwaveCheckout` exists after the script loads.

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### 1. Check Browser Console

When you load the wallet page, you should see:
```
Flutterwave script loaded
```

### 2. Check Network Tab

In DevTools → Network, you should see:
```
checkout.flutterwave.com/v3.js - Status: 200
```

### 3. Try a Payment

Click "Fund Wallet" and the modal should open immediately!

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Payment system not ready" error

**Cause:** Script hasn't loaded yet

**Solution:**
1. Wait a few seconds after page load
2. Refresh the page
3. Check browser console for script loading errors

### Modal doesn't open

**Cause:** Script failed to load or public key is wrong

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY` is set
3. Make sure you're online (script loads from CDN)

### TypeScript error in IDE

**Cause:** IDE hasn't recognized the global declaration

**Solution:**
1. Save the file
2. Restart TypeScript server in VSCode (Cmd+Shift+P → "TypeScript: Restart TS Server")
3. The error should disappear
